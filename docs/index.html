	<h1>Test Page for Gulp Template</h1>

	<p>All of the tests below should pass while viewing the page in your browser as a live app (after running "gulp") and as a finished build (after running "gulp build")</p>

	<p><a href="https://github.com/JoelCDL/gulp_template">View this project on GitHub</a> for more information.</p>

	<h2>Feature Tests</h2>

	<h3>Sass and CSS</h3>

	<p class="testing-sass2">If Sass is compiling and CSS is loading successfully, then return "Yes" (or nothing if unsuccessful): </p>

	<h3>HTML Fragments</h3>
	
	
<p>This text is being included via #include file="" directive.</p>


<p>This text is being included within an include.</p>


<!-- Note that #include virual="" doesn't work with lbInclude plugin -->

	<h3>Loading of Scripts</h3>

	<p>Custom jQuery is <span class="jquery-test-fail">not</span> working from script #1.</p>

	<p class="disappear">If clicking this text makes it disappear, then script #2 is loading.</p>

	<p>After a build is created, both scripts above will be concatenated into one and should still work.</p>

	<h3>HTML Validation</h3>

	<p>The folowing image contains the validation error "sizes must not be empty" that will return in your terminal after running "gulp validateHTML":</p>

	<!-- The img below will throw an HTML validation error via the w3cjs task ("sizes" must not be empty): -->

	<p>
		<img
	    src="/path1/"
	    srcset="/path1/ 60w, /path2/ 50w"
	    sizes=""
	    alt="[image containing validation error]">
	</p>

	<h3>Modernizr</h3>

	<p>For screens that don't feature touch event capabilities, Modernizr is currently <span class="test-modernizr">not</span> presenting the "no-touchevents" class on the html element for use in styling alternatives to touch event features.</p>

	<h3>Background Images as Base64 within CSS</h3>

	<p>If the icons are appearing to the left of the text, then the images are successfully imbedded within the CSS as Base64:</p>

	<p class="icon1">Facebook</p>
	<p class="icon2">Instagram</p>
	<p class="icon3">Pinterest</p>
